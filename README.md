Live demo - https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/veronaten-JSFE2021Q1/virtual-piano/


In this project I use native JavaScript. I added sound to an electronic piano. This piano can be played with a mouse and keyboard. On it, you can do glissando with both the mouse and the keys. 
There is a switch button notes/ letters, button fullscreen.
